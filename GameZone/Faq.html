<h1 class="t1">What happens when I don’t have any Shields?</h1><br>
<h2 class="t2">If you don’t have any Shields while you’re offline, you might be attacked by other players. If you lose, part of your resources will be taken by your opponent. You can build Defenses, Walls, and Traps to protect your Castle.</h2><br><br>
